## Cordova Plugin that wraps Mixpanel sdk for android and ios

- [android sdk version 4.7.0](https://github.com/mixpanel/mixpanel-android/tree/v4.7.0)
- [ios sdk version 2.9.1](https://github.com/mixpanel/mixpanel-iphone/tree/v2.9.1)

#### Install

```
for cordova version > 5.x.x:
  cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-mixpanel

older versions:
  cordova plugin add https://github.com/samzilverberg/cordova-mixpanel-plugin.git
```

#### Usage

**window.mixpanel:**

- alias(aliasId, originalId, onSuccess, onFail)
  - also available as ```createAlias```
- distinctId(function onSuccess(distinctId), onFail)
- flush(onSuccess, onFail)
- identify(distinctId, onSuccess, onFail)
- init(token, onSuccess, onFail)
- registerSuperProperties(superProperties, onSuccess, onFail)
- reset(onSuccess, onFail)
- track(eventName, eventProperties, onSuccess, onFail)
- showSurvey(onSuccess, onFail) **currently only iOS**
  -  by default the SDK attempts to show any available survey at app launch.  If you'd like to trigger a survey after a particular action though use this.

**window.mixpanel.people:**

- identify(distinctId, onSuccess, onFail)
- increment(peopleProperties, onSuccess, onFail)
- setPushId(pushId, onSuccess, onFail)
  - More info about push notifications at:
    - [android](https://mixpanel.com/site_media/doctyl/uploads/Android-spec/com/mixpanel/android/mpmetrics/MixpanelAPI.People.html#initPushHandling(java.lang.String))
    - [ios](https://mixpanel.com/help/reference/ios-push-notifications)
  - Usage example using the [PhoneGap Push Plugin](https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap-plugin-push):
  ```
    var push = PushNotification.init({
        'android': {'senderID': '<GCM Sender ID>'},
        'ios': {'alert': 'true', 'badge': 'true', 'sound': 'true'}
    });
    push.on('registration', function(data) {
      mixpanel.people.setPushId(data.registrationId, function onSuccess(){}, function onFail(){});
    });
  ```
- set(peopleProperties, onSuccess, onFail)
- setOnce(peopleProperties, onSuccess, onFail)
- trackCharge(amount, properties, onSuccess, onFail)
- deleteUser(onSuccess, onFail)


## TODOs
- add more Mixpanel People operations
  - unset, more?
- add showSurvey to Android
- make sure ios/android use same error messages
- refactor ios code
  - remove code duplication of checking that mixpanel was init


## Contributing and Testing

contributions of all sorts to the source code are more than welcome.
any contribution will be noted in the changeslog (for FAME! :-D ).

Please try to test your contributions using your cordova project or a dummy test project.

## Troubleshooting

### IOS

#### hey i installed the plugin and now build fails, why?

open your xcode proj, goto **build phases -> link binary with libraries**:
  - drag all files under folder 'frameworks' (on the left) to here
  - add the following if missing:
      - libicucore
      - cfnetwork

#### i get error 'Mixpanel' plugin not found, check config.xml

appears to be some problem of the xcode proj settings.
only working solution i found so far is to
```
cordova platform remove ios
cordova platform add ios
cordova build ios
```
and setting up the build phase correctly again, as described in last question.


#### hey i'm on iOS>9 and nothing is happening, why?

google for NSAppTransportSecurity.
since iOS9 they are more strict about what your app is allowed to connect to.
you will have to manually add some entries to your app plist file to allow network connectivity to mixpanel server.
